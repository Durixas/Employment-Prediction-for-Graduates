# Employment Prediction for Graduates from a Campus

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether students would get placed after graduation through the development of a Python-based model. The predictive factors include grades, degree specialization, and work experience.

## Key Highlights

- **Model Development:** Developed a predictive model in Python to forecast the likelihood of students getting placed after graduation.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, encompassing data cleaning, categorical feature transformation, and data standardization, to ensure the quality and suitability of the dataset for modeling.

- **Model Establishment:** Utilized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) models. Employed Grid Search based on 5-fold cross-validation to identify optimal model hyperparameters for enhanced performance.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of each model on test data, selecting the best-performing model based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, with the best AUC achieving a high value of 0.96.
